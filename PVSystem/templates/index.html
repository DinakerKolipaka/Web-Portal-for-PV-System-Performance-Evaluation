<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px">A PV system or a Photovoltaic system uses photovoltaics to produce electrical energy from
sunlight for commercial or household use. The major component of this system is the array
of PV modules which constitute a solar panel. With the growing concerns about global
warming and climate change, a shift towards the renewable sources of energy is of utmost
importance. Solar energy is one of the most abundantly available renewable source of
energy and scientists and researchers have been working for years for efficient conversion
of this energy for human use. The mere development of efficient PV systems is not enough.
These systems need to be certified before making them available for installation. This
certification is done based on the performance of a PV system in different weather
conditions. A group of different functional teams work together in the process of
certification. First, the manufacturers need to provide information about their systems. This
information along with weather forecasting data is used to calculate the performance of the
system. This data then needs to be made available to the certification body and insurance
agents. This is a complex process and there are no good central systems available for the
collaboration of these teams. There is also the lack of a system for performance calculation.
The goal of this project is to develop a common platform to bridge the gap between PV
system manufacturers, insurance agents, certification board and the end users for easy and
efficient exchange of information.</p>
